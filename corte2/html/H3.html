    <p>This recipe makes quick, <strong><em>tasty hummus</em></strong>, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads. Ingredients</p>
    
    <ol> <!-- Lista ordenada -->
        <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li> <!-- Elemento de la lista -->
        <li>175g of tahini</li>
        <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li>a red pepper</li>
        <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Instructions</h2> <!-- Subtítulo -->

    <p> Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely Add all the ingredients into a food processor Process all the ingredients into a paste. If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time
    </p>

    <p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.

    <h2>Storage</h2> <!-- Subtítulo para la sección de almacenamiento -->

    <p>
        Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it. Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
